<h1 align=center>  <b>Why Pin Bhaba Is A Must-Do Trek?</b></h1>

<p align=center>
We always keep hearing about the Pin Bhabha Pass as a comparison to the Pin Parvati Pass Trek. In reality, they are extremely different treks. Though they have only Pin Valley in common. Pin Bhabha Pass is the confluence of the Pin and Bhabha valleys. That also means it is the perfect mixture of Himalayan greenery and aridness.

The Bhabha side of the trek is a cruise to livelihood. It is filled with dense alpine forests of Pine, Oak, and Silver Birch. The beginning of the trek is through long dense trees alongside the Bhabha river. Very rarely is there long trudging through pine forests. Slowly as you gain height huge grasslands flourished with vibrant blossoms come into the picture. Most of the campsites are on pastures with the Bhabha River and lakes beside the tents. Kara grasslands are the most popular amongst shepherds. Goats, horses, etc. can be seen in abundance here.

The more you rise above, gradually the vegetation is lost to scree, snow, and moraines. The path to the Pin Bhabha Pass will test your endurance just like any other pass trek. But the moment you reach the Pass, it is a complete contradiction to the sights seen until now. Suddenly the brown, yellow, and red mountains pop up while entering Pin Valley. This marks the start of Spiti. This turning of scenery is awesome and remains in my memories forever.
