<h1 align=center>  <b>Why is Doodhpathri Trek a Must-Do Trek?</b></h1>

<p align=center>
While Kashmir Great Lakes and Tarsar Marsar are two popular treks in Kashmir, not many people know about the wonderful Doodhpathri Trek. It is one of the lesser-known destinations in Kashmir that doesn’t receive much tourism but showcases immense natural beauty and plenty of peace and tranquility. Located about 55 km away from Srinagar, this offbeat trek is a great choice if you want to experience the raw and seemingly untouched beauty of Kashmir.

Kashmir is known for its beautiful meadows, and the Doodhpathri Trek is undoubtedly one of the best scenic splendours of Kashmir. Lying under the shadows of the Pir Panjal Range and the Shailganga River cutting across the valley, the Bodhpathri Trek is full of beauty and peacefulness. The trail follows this beautiful River to its source near the Ashtar Glacier, with lush carpets of undulating green as far as eyes can see.

The Doodhpathri Trek lets you experience 7 wonderful lakes, which are so beautiful that they will completely enchant you. This region of  Kashmir was out of bounds until a couple of years ago and now you have the opportunity to explore the unexplored part of Kashmir – its forests, valleys, meadows, streams, rivers, and lakes.
